Window Manager with Animated Cubes
Overview
This project features a dynamic window management system with animated cubes positioned based on the layout of active windows. Utilizing Three.js and WebGL, this interactive system renders cubes that move and rotate smoothly based on the position of windows on the screen. The cubes adjust their size, color, and movement as the window setup changes, creating a visually striking effect that reacts to user interactions.

Features
Responsive Window Management: Tracks the position and size of the browser windows in real-time.
Smooth Transitions: The cubes smoothly follow the window changes with easing effects, making the animations visually appealing.
Dynamic Cube Positioning: Cubes' positions are dynamically updated based on the windows' positions, providing a unique, interactive experience.
Customizable: The system is highly extensible, with hooks available for adding custom window metadata and additional interactions.
Three.js Based: Utilizes Three.js for rendering the 3D scene and objects, ensuring smooth and efficient graphics handling.

How It Works
Window Management:

The system listens to window events and tracks changes in their shape and position using the WindowManager class.
Every time a window's position or size changes, the cubes in the scene update to reflect the new layout.
Scene Setup:

A Three.js scene is initialized with an orthographic camera, creating a 3D environment for the cubes.
The cubes are animated to follow window changes using smooth transitions and rotational animations.
Cubes' Behavior:

Each cube is dynamically sized and positioned based on the number and position of the windows.
As windows are added or removed, the cubes are re-generated, and the world is re-positioned.
Smooth Easing:

The sceneOffset is adjusted to create a smooth scrolling effect as the window moves.
Falloff values are used to ensure that the cubes move in a fluid, visually pleasing manner.

Key Files
WindowManager.js: Handles window interactions and stores metadata for each window instance.
main.js: Initializes the Three.js scene, renderer, camera, and manages the cubes.
index.html: The basic HTML structure that includes the canvas for rendering the scene.
Configuration
You can modify several aspects of the system:

Window Shape: The appearance and behavior of windows can be customized by interacting with the WindowManager instance.
Cubes' Appearance: Cubes are created dynamically based on window positions. You can adjust their sizes, colors, and rotations by altering the parameters in main.js.
Rendering: You can tweak the WebGL renderer's settings, like the pixel ratio and antialiasing, to suit your visual needs.
Developer Notes
The project utilizes Three.js for 3D rendering, which makes it easy to animate objects and scenes in the browser using WebGL.
WindowManager.js is designed to manage multiple windows and is modular enough to integrate into other projects.
The resize function automatically adjusts the scene to fit the window's dimensions, ensuring a responsive design.
The cubes' colors are dynamically generated using HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), ensuring a visually distinct effect as the windows change.
